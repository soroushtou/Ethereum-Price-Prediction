# Ethereum-Price-Prediction
A python deep learning program to predict ethereum prices using LSTM networks. It uses LSTM networks to predict the price for four days. The data I used for the training and testing process is from a Kaggle Dataset.

The provided data is updated until May. 2021. Because the price goes up to 4000$ on the latest days and my data was limited to May. 2021, I decided to use 95% of the data for training and the rest for testing. The biggest limitation is its four days prediction. It can be improved to become functional.

The data I used is from a kaggle Dataset :

Note: This program can predict the price for 4 days, and it is not tested in real conditions.
I just tested it on the actual dataset.
